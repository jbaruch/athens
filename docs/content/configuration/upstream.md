title: Configuring Upstream Proxy to use Go modules repository
description: How to Fetch modules directly from a Go modules repository such as GoCenter
weight: 1
---

The upstream proxy used when fetching modules directly is by default the actual source, e.g github.com. This can be configured to use a Go modules repository like GoCenter.

1. Create a filter file (e.g /usr/local/lib/FilterForGoCenter) with letter "D" in first line. For more details, please refer to documentation on  - [Filtering Modules](/configuration/filter)

```
# FilterFile for fetching modules directly from upstream
D
```
2. If you are not using a config file, create a new config file (based on the sample config.dev.toml and edit values to match your environment).
Additionally in the config file, set the following parameters as suggested:

```
FilterFile = "/usr/local/lib/FilterForGoCenter"
GlobalEndpoint = "https://<url_to_uptream>"
# To use GoCenter for example, replace <url_to_upstream> with gocenter.io
```

3. Restart Athens specifying the new config file.

e.g **.```
/proxy  -config_file <path-to new-configfile>
```**
You should see


INFO[0000] Exporter not specified. Traces won't be exported

2019-03-14 14:11:58.492060 I | Starting application at port :3000

4. To verify, follow the same instructions to get up the go environment variable:

              GO111MODULE=on, and
              GOPROXY=http://127.0.0.1:3000

And go through the same walkthrough example.

5. If you see messages display status code [303], Athens is redirecting to GoCenter.

6. If you get 404, it means the module is not found in GoCenter. Please access GoCenter via https://gocenter.io and add your module for inclusion.
